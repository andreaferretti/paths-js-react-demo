Paths.js Demo application
=========================

This is an application to demonstrate the use of [Paths.js](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js) with [Facebook React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) to create interactive SVG graphics.

Running
-------

The application uses [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). To run it, first install the dependencies with

    npm install

Then a running server can start with

    npm start

Status
------

The demo is still incomplete, and fails to show many of Paths.js features. A more complete demo can be found [here](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js-demo).
